# Hello cloud-init

The purpose of this communication is to provide a status update and
highlights for any interesting subjects from cloud-init upstream. If
you would like to reach the server team, you can find us at
the #cloud-init channel on Freenode. Alternatively, you can sign up
and use the cloud-init [mailing list](mailto:cloud-init@lists.launchpad.net)
[cloud-init discourse hub](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/server/cloud-init) for more
discussion.

## Spotlight:
Cloud-init StableReleaseUpdate(SRU) verification has begun for version 20.4. We track this effort in an [SRU process for cloud-init release of 20.4 into Xenial, Bionic and Groovy](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1905599). Details of the overall verification progress will be represented in the [public SRU cloud-init 20.4 trello board](https://trello.com/b/hP1KfPeU/sru-cloud-init-204).

The SRU effort generally takes > 1 week as the team validates any significant feature change or bug fix that affects stable Ubuntu releases. To reduce the cost of such verification, we are extending the cloud-init's ./tests/integration_tests to cover each bug and feature verification.

  We encourage anyone in the community interested in SRU involvement to participate in one of two ways:

 1. [Test cloud-init upgrades manually](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/debugging.html#stable-release-updates-sru-testing-for-cloud-init) on your cloud-of-choice and report results for that cloud on our SRU [process bug for 20.4](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1905599)
 2. Try writing a new [tests/integration_test](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/integration_tests.html) to verify one of the [cloud-init bugs or features included in the 20.4 SRU](https://trello.com/c/cw8YUo1o/35-preliminary-write-integration-tests-for-commits-in-sru)

  To avoid duplication of work, when a developer owns an integration_test item, they assign their trello avatar to the specific entry in the ["tests we can write" checklist]([200~https://trello.com/c/cw8YUo1o/35-preliminary-write-integration-tests-for-commits-in-sru). We welcome any participation here and we will certainly help folks in developing these tests to expedite the verification of cloud-init.
