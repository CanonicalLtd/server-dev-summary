# Ubuntu Sever Development Summary
This repository is used by the Canonical Server team to develop the weekly
development summary that is sent out to the community as a whole. This summary
is used to communicate accomplishments and progress made by the server team
over the previous week.

## Template
The template is a starter to generating the weekly summary. This is used to
allow whoever is working on the summary to focus on content and not style.
