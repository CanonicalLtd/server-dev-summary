## git-ubuntu subcommand
For those unfamiliar with the new Ubuntu git merge workflow in
ubuntu-server packages, the high level process can be seen here:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/Merging/GitWorkflow
 
Install it with:
 
    sudo snap install --classic git-ubuntu
 
There are not too many changes to the released git-ubuntu command this past week, beyond cleanups. We are staging some larger changes for empty directory support (a git issue generally) and to standardize our namespaces in the tooling.
