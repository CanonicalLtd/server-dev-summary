# Hello cloud-init

The purpose of this communication is to provide a status update and
highlights for any interesting subjects from cloud-init upstream. If
you would like to reach the server team, you can find us at
the #cloud-init channel on Freenode. Alternatively, you can sign up
and use the cloud-init [mailing list](mailto:cloud-init@lists.launchpad.net)
[cloud-init discourse hub](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/server/cloud-init) for more
discussion.

## Spotlight:
Canonical is working to start an SRU release of cloud-init 21.1 from tip of master into Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, 20.04, 20.10 and 21.04 within the next week. Expect an email to the mailing list to notifying  the cloud-init community of this SRU effort. When the SRU bits are uploaded into Ubuntu's -proposed pockets, anyone help would be appreciated [manually testing on your favorite cloud](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/debugging.html?highlight=sru%20validation#manual-sru-verification-procedure). Details will come to the cloud-init mailinglist.
