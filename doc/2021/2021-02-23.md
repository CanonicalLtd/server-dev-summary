## Spotlight:
Cloud-init upstream just cut the [21.1 upstream release](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1916540). The release showcases the following features:
 - New datasource for UpCloud
 - Introduced support for reading Openstack dynamic vendor0-data
 - Add support for VMWare's raw data feature
 - Add support for Azure VMs without ephemeral resource disks

This release has been uploaded to Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute) and the plan is to
SRU this release, plus some OVS support to Ubuntu Xenial, Bionic, Focal and
Groovy in the next week or two.
