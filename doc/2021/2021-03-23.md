## Spotlight:
Call for testing: SRU of 21.1-19 SRU for Ubuntu
-----------------------------------------------
An upload of cloud-init v.21.1-19 for SRU release verification targeting
Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial), 18.04 (Bionic), 20.04 (Focal) and 20.10 (Groovy).

The next week will be spent verifying this upload for official
SRU (Stable Release Update into Ubuntu).

If you have the means, please attempt to [manually verify proposed cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/debugging.html?highlight=sru#manual-sru-verification-procedure)
on your favorite cloud platform. Test validation feedback is welcome in:
- IRC on Freenode `#cloud-init`
- as a comment on [the cloud-init SRU bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1920272) 
- on the [cloud-init mailing list](mailto:cloud-init@lists.launchpad.net).

Thanks all for helping improve cloud-init!
