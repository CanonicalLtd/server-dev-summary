# Ubuntu Sever Development Summary
This repository is used by the Canonical Server team to develop the weekly
development summary that is sent out to the community as a whole. This summary
is used to communicate accomplishments and progress made by the server team
over the previous week.

allow whoever is working on the summary to focus on content and not style.
